<h3>About</h3>

<p>Tech, Rebalanced was started to get more marginalized genders and sexes (women, trans and non-binary folks) into tech. Each year in D.C. hundreds gather for a day of friendly learning and hacking. Coders, tech strategists, newbies, nerds, and the curious are all welcome!
<br><br>
Tech, Rebalanced (formally Tech Lady Hackathon) was founded in 2013 by <a href="http://twitter.com/leahbannon">Leah Bannon</a>.  After Leah's move to San Francisco in 2015, a new group of organizers took over. The 2018 Hackathon and Training Day will be curated and run by <a href="https://twitter.com/joymwhitt">Joy Whitt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dataKateR">Kate Rabinowitz</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/KellyFMill">Kelly Miller</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/rekhatenjarla">Rekha Tenjarla</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/EmDohh">Meag Doherty</a> </p>
