<h3>About</h3>

<p>Tech Lady Hackathon was started to get more women and enbies into tech. Each year in D.C. hundreds gather for a day of friendly learning and hacking. Coders, tech strategists, newbies, nerds, and the curious are all welcome!
<br><br>
Tech Lady Hackathon was founded in 2013 by <a href="http://twitter.com/leahbannon">Leah Bannon</a>.  After Leah's move to San Francisco in 2015, <a href="https://twitter.com/jessicagarson">Jessica Garson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joymwhitt">Joy Whitt</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dataKateR">Kate Rabinowitz</a> took over as organizers for Tech Lady Hackathon. In 2017 <a href="https://twitter.com/AyRenay">Alexis Johnson-Gresham</a> joined as a co-organizer.</p>
